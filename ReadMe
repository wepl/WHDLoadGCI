WHDLoad - Graphical Coders Interface

a user interface to view whdloads coredump files

to run you need:

	MUI 3.8			http://www.sasg.com/
	MCC_BetterString	http://www.amiga.dk/tumult/
	MCC_HexEdit		http://www.amiga.dk/tumult/

its compiled using gcc 2.95, sasc may work too
	
it is still incomplete and there are many things I want to have added.
any work on it from you would be very welcome!

it's recommended to set a nonproportional font in the BetterString config.
